GraphQL API with TypeScript
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a robust and efficient GraphQL API using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript. The API implements strong typing, authentication, and caching while integrating with MongoDB for database operations and Redis for caching frequently accessed resources.

Features
Built using TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
GraphQL schema and resolvers defined using TypeScript.
Authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
Database integration with MongoDB using Mongoose.
Redis caching for improved performance of frequently accessed data.
Input validation and error handling for secure and reliable data operations.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (locally or a cloud instance)
Redis
Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphql-api-typescript.git
cd graphql-api-typescript
Install dependencies:

npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

PORT=4000  
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname  
REDIS_HOST=localhost  
REDIS_PORT=6379  
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret  
Start MongoDB and Redis servers locally or ensure they are running on your cloud environment.

Start the application:

npm start
API Endpoints
GraphQL Playground
The API exposes a GraphQL Playground at:

http://localhost:4000/graphql
Example Queries and Mutations
Authentication (JWT Token Generation)
mutation {
  login(username: "example", password: "password123") {
    token
  }
}
Fetch Data (with caching enabled)
query {
  getItems {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
Create New Data
mutation {
  createItem(input: { name: "New Item", description: "This is a new item" }) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
